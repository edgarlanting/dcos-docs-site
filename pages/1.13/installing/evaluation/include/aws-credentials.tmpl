# Install and configure the Amazon CLI

1. Set up an [Amazon Web Services account](https://aws.amazon.com/) if you don't already have one. Make sure to have at least one [user role set up in the AWS IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) to get the necessary access keys.

2. Set up the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) if you don't already have it. Python users of `pip` can install the latest version of the AWS CLI with the command:

    ```bash
    pip install awscli --upgrade --user
    ```

    For other installation methods please see the [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html#install-tool-bundled).

3. Once you have the AWS CLI, it needs to be connected to the account you would like to use. If you already had the CLI installed, you may already have your credentials set up. To set up your credentials, or to update them anytime as needed, run:

    ```bash
    aws configure --profile=<your-profile-name>
    ```
    The AWS CLI will request four pieces of information. Paste or enter in your Access Key Id and Secret Access Key that you were given by Amazon, and if you set the region as above, it will already be filled in for you:

    ```bash
    AWS Access Key ID [None]: <accesskey>
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <secretkey>
    Default region name [None]: <choose-a-region>
    Default output format [None]: <if-blank-default-is-json>
    ```
    If you have previously added in any values, they will be listed within the square brackets as [previous value]. Leaving the input blank will preserve the value as it is, adding or changing a value here will update it.

    See [configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) for more information on setting up credentials and user profile.

4. Set the `AWS_PROFILE`. Terraform will need to communicate your credentials to AWS. This should be the same profile associated with the access keys entered in when configuring the AWS CLI above.

    ```bash
    export AWS_PROFILE="<your-AWS-profile>"
    ```

    Ensure it has been set:

    ```bash
    echo $AWS_PROFILE
    <your-AWS-profile>
    ```
