## Verify you have a license key for Enterprise Edition
DC/OS Enterprise requires a valid license key provided by Mesosphere that will be passed into the `main.tf` configuration file as `dcos_license_key_contents`. Use the default superuser and password to log in:

Username: `bootstrapuser`<br>
Password: `deleteme`

<p class="message--important"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>You should NOT use the default credentials in a production environment. When you create or identify an administrative account for the production environment, you also need to generate a password hash for the account.</p>
